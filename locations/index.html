<p>The venues for both the ceremony and the reception are close to public transport and easy to reach. The church is in Jarrow, where we live, and the reception venue is in Newcastle city centre where we both work.</p>

<p>We will be providing transport from the church to the hotel after the ceremony, by either taxi or minibus, depending on demand. Please indicate on your RSVP if you would like a seat.</p>

<h3>The Ceremony</h3>

<p>The ceremony is at our local church, Christ Church in Jarrow.  It is located on the corner of Grange Road West and Ellison Street in central Jarrow.</p>

<p>Jarrow metro and bus stations are close by, both just a short journey from Newcastle city centre.  On the metro take a yellow line train towards South Shields.  By bus take the Go North East Crusader, number 27.</p>

<p>Although there is no car park at the church there is on-street parking available, and a large car park at Morrison's a few minutes' walk away.</p>

<h3>The Reception</h3>

<p>The wedding breakfast and reception are at The County Hotel, Newcastle.  Until recently this was a Thistle hotel, but has since been acquired by Accor, spent a brief period as part of The Hotel Collection, and is now a Mercure hotel.  It is directly opposite Newcastle Central Station, on the corner of Neville Street and Grainger Street.</p>

<p>Limited on-site car parking is available for hotel residents on a first-come-first-served basis, at an additional charge.  There are several public car parks nearby.  The nearest is the <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/search/Newgate+Hotel+Car+Park,+Newcastle/@54.9715253,-1.6182839,17z/data=!3m1!4b1">Newgate Hotel car park</a>, accessible by Falconar's Court off Fenkle Street, but this is a little difficult to find and quite expensive.  A better alternative is the <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/search/NE1+4DP/@54.96909,-1.623118,17z/data=!3m1!4b1">Grainger Town car park</a>, accessible from Waterloo Street.</p>
